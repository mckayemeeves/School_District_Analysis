# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose of Analysis
It came to our attention that the original data was tainted with academic dishonesty so in this code, I replaced all the 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School with "NAN" so that state-testing standards would still be upheld.
## Results
### District Summary Affect:
Thomas High School has 461 9th graders and the affected scores were under math, reading, and the overall score. The orignal district data shows slightly higher grades than after the changes took place. For example, the average reading score was 81.88% and the % passing math was 74.98%. After changing the data the results revealed very similar scores. For example, the altered data average reading score was 81.86 and the % passing math was 74.76%. When rounded to whole numbers, the results would still be the same compared to the previous district score.
### School Summary Affect:
The school itself was a completely different story. The original overal school passing rate was 91% which seemed suspiciously high. After removing the 9th grade students math and reading scores, the new overal passing percent became 65.07%. This is a significant difference.
### Replacing grades relative to other schools
The original analysis had Thomas High School ranked second in the district, which seemed suspicious. After altering the data, the new results show Thomas High School to be 8th in the district.
#### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade: In the original analysis Thomas High School had a 83.6 math average and 83.7 reading average for 9th graders. The test scores were then replaced with nan which show the other grades, 10th, 11th, 12th as doing slightly better than before

## Summary
### Four changes that took place
1. In reports, the 9th grade reading and math data averages have been nullified and are completely unusable since they were tainted with the cheating.
2. Overall passing rate at THS saw a significant change as it went from 91% to 65%
3. Campus math and reading averages had minor shifts
4. THS went from 2nd to 8th in the district of 15 schools
